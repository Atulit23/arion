        "content": "In practice, training a diffusion model involves using a dataset and performing both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. For example, with a cat image x\u2080, the forward diffusion process adds noise over several steps. At each timestep t, a neural network is trained to predict the noise added. The loss function is calculated by comparing the predicted noise to the actual noise added, and gradient descent is used to minimize this loss. After the model is trained, image generation is performed by starting from pure Gaussian noise (x\u209c ~ N(0, I)) and iteratively applying the reverse diffusion process until a clean image is generated at timestep t = 0. This process allows the model to generate new images by reversing the noise process rather than directly generating the image."

        "title": "Reverse Diffusion Process and Training Objective",
        "content": "The reverse diffusion process is aimed at recovering the original image from its noisy version. The training objective involves training a neural network, \u03f5\u03b8(x\u209c, t), to predict the noise at each timestep during the reverse diffusion process. The denoising step involves the model using the predicted noise to iteratively reduce the noise added during the forward diffusion process. This step is critical for the model to learn how to reverse the diffusion and generate a clean image. The training objective is typically simplified to the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), which helps the network focus on predicting the added noise rather than the image itself. The goal is for the model to minimize the error in its noise predictions across all timesteps."

        "title": "Reverse Diffusion and Variational Inference",
        "content": "The process of reverse diffusion begins with random Gaussian noise. At each time step, the model subtracts the predicted noise (essentially ordering the chaos), and then adds a bit of fresh Gaussian noise to maintain the stochasticity of the process. This reverse diffusion is iteratively performed for T steps, where T is typically a large number (such as 1000 steps). During this process, the model gradually transforms the noisy image back into a clean image. In practice, this approach is implemented using a neural network that predicts the noise added at each step. The model does not directly predict the image itself, but rather the noise that was added at each step of the forward diffusion process."

        "title": "Variational Lower Bound and Training Objective",
        "content": "In generative models like diffusion models, maximizing the likelihood of data directly is not feasible. Instead, we approximate this likelihood using a Variational Lower Bound (VLB), based on the principles of Variational Inference. The goal is to maximize the log-likelihood of the data, but since direct computation is intractable, we use Jensen\u2019s Inequality to derive a lower bound. This lower bound is referred to as the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). To optimize the ELBO, the training process involves minimizing three primary loss components: reconstruction loss, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between true and predicted distributions, and prior matching loss at the final timestep. The KL divergence between Gaussian distributions has a closed-form solution, simplifying the calculation. These components together define the model's training objective, focusing on predicting the noise added at each diffusion step rather than directly predicting the image."

        "title": "Markovian Forward Diffusion Process and Dataset",
        "content": "To begin the training of diffusion models, a dataset, such as images of cats, is required. These images, represented as x \u2208 R\u00b3\u02e3\u00b2\u2075\u2076\u02e3\u00b2\u2075\u2076, are subjected to a forward diffusion process where Gaussian noise is gradually added over a series of T steps (often T = 1000). At each step t, a noise schedule \u03b2\u209c defines the amount of noise to be added, starting with smaller noise at the beginning and gradually increasing it. The term \u221a(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u209c) scales down the image as noise increases, while \u03b2\u209cI represents the Gaussian noise added at each timestep. A key feature of this process is that rather than sampling sequentially from each step, one can directly jump to any timestep t, which allows for flexibility in the model's behavior during training."

        "title": "Understanding Image Generation and Loss Computation",
        "content": "In this level, we start with understanding the process of generating an image using a dataset. The first step is obtaining an initial image, denoted as x\u2080, from the dataset. This represents the base image that will be used for further processing. We then randomly choose a timestep t from a uniform distribution U(1,T), where T is the total number of timesteps in the process. This random selection helps simulate the noise process at different stages. Next, we generate a noisy image based on the timestep t. The noisy image is produced by adding random noise to the original image x\u2080, which is a standard technique in generative models to create variability and challenge the model in learning the clean data distribution. The model then predicts the noise that was added to the image. This prediction is crucial for training the model to differentiate between noise and real data. Finally, we compute the loss, which measures how far the model's prediction of the noise is from the actual noise that was added. The loss function helps guide the training process by providing feedback to the model on how to adjust its parameters to improve predictions in future iterations."

        "title": "Introduction to Noise and Image Prediction Process",
        "content": "This level focuses on the broader understanding of how noise is integrated into the image generation process. To begin, you need to understand that the image generation process is often performed in steps, where noise is gradually added to the image. The timestep t is chosen from a uniform distribution U(1,T), which means each timestep has an equal probability of being selected. This selection ensures that the noise is applied in a controlled manner across different stages of the image generation process. The noisy image is generated by adding noise to the original image x\u2080, and this noisy version is used to help the model learn how to reverse the noise addition process. By predicting the added noise, the model essentially learns how to recover the original image from the noisy version, a concept widely used in diffusion models. The model's ability to predict noise correctly is essential for generating high-quality, realistic images in the training process."
